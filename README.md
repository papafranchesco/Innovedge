This is a pet project LLM-based telegram bot. The main idea was to create a bot for students (and potentially, other job-seekers) and employers suitable for university environment with "dating-bot" functionality. The final toolset includes Python backend, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and ollama (local llama-3.2:1b) for segmenting users for recommendational system.


Nota bene: this version of the project is only "MVP" and requires further development and tests, as well as investigating the room for recommendational system, but the general idea is preserved
